# About

I use [rubular.com](rubular.com) constantly, and wanted to make something similar that I could keep closer at hand in the console.

# TODO

- [ ] fix splitting on the captured text instead of using the index of the matches (i.e. ctrl-s `me.$`)
- [ ] implement different color captures
- [ ] fix highlight capturing the newline with ctrl-s
